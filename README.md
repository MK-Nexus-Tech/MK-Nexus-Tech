## 🚀 What I Do

I build institutional-grade financial dashboards and structured SaaS systems for accounting firms and finance teams.

My focus:

* Accounts Receivable intelligence systems
* Financial reporting automation
* Executive KPI visualization
* Internal tools that replace spreadsheets
* Secure data-driven reporting platforms

I transform raw exports from QuickBooks and Xero into clear, decision-ready systems built with React and TypeScript.
